description: An introduction to my new website and what I used to build&nbsp;it.
---
I ditched the [old version of my site][mf-old] --built with [Laravel][laravel-home], a great PHP framework-- in favor of something even simpler.  I wanted the ability to have a blog without the need to develop one from scratch or use something heavy like [WordPress][wordpress-home].  Despite really wanting to try [Ghost][ghost-blog], it was out of the question too.  I need more than _just_ a&nbsp;blog.

The solution was [Jekyll][jekyll].

### What's Jekyll? ###
Jekyll is an open-source static site generator. It's easy to get running --its homepage lists the four quick-start instructions that take just minutes to run-- and it's easy to use. I was ready to update to my new site after just a few collective nights of tinkering after work to design the new layout, create new content, and transfer mostly all of my old&nbsp;content.

Since Jekyll builds a static website --no database or server-side processing-- it's fast, secure, and easily hosted just about anywhere.  If I didn't already have shared web hosting I could be [hosting it for free on GitHub][github-hosting].

Check out [Jekyll on GitHub][jekyll-gh] for even more information on&nbsp;Jekyll.

### New Design ###
For a fresh design I built off a fantastic mobile-friendly theme by [@mdo][mdo-twitter] called [Hyde][hyde-gh]. I made changes to fit my liking and ensure it doesn't look exactly like all the other sites using&nbsp;Hyde.

The typeface, [Raleway][raleway-home], is provided by [Google Fonts][raleway-gf].

### Open Source ###
I use open source software on a daily basis. In an effort to contribute to the community the entire source for this website can be found on [GitHub][mf-gh].  Feel free to use it, learn from it, or critique&nbsp;it!
