description: A brief overview of my teams' work at the 2014 Twin Cities&nbsp;<a href="http://tc2014.overnightwebsitechallenge.com/">Overnight Website&nbsp;Challenge</a>.
---
Every year [The Nerdery][nerdery-home] hosts [The Overnight Website Challenge][owc-home] -- an event where local web development professionals volunteer a day of their life to build a website for a deserving nonprofit&nbsp;organization.

Teams of 8-10 with skills in front-end development, back-end development, project management, strategy, UX, graphic design, copywriting, and QA self organize and get randomly matched with a nonprofit organization. They get 24 hours to build the nonprofit the site of their dreams until it's mice and keyboards down the next&nbsp;day.

My team was paired with [Home for Life][hfl-owc], a long-term animal sanctuary specializing in rescuing animals who may be old, disabled, or suffering from health or temperament problems. We were able to build a fully responsive website for Home for Life that met all of their major&nbsp;needs.

I'm really proud of what our team was able to accomplish in the 24 sleep-deprived, coffee and RedBull fueled hours.  If you're a web development professional in the vicinity of the next Overnight Website Challenge -- there were simultaneous events in Chicago and Kansas City this year -- I highly recommend you gather a team and sign&nbsp;up.
