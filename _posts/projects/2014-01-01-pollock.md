Pollock.js is a simple JavaScript tool for jump-starting the Canvas--named after [the artist][pollock-wiki].  

It wires up your canvas elements with an animation loop while simultaneously providing useful utility functions and event hooks.

All it takes is a little bit of code and you can start throwing things at your canvas:
{% highlight javascript %}
var scene = new Pollock({
  canvasID: "myCanvas"
});
{% endhighlight %}

### Demo ###
In addition to the demo you see above, you can try a [fullscreen interactive demo][pollock-full]. Please note that the fullscreen demo is not optimized for mobile devices.

I also use Pollock with my [particle engine][particle-mf], among other projects.

### Download ###
You can download it, tell me about bugs, or make a feature request at [Pollock.js's GitHub repo][pollock-gh].
