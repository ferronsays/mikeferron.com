Lucky Streak is my entry into the 2013 [Js13kGames][js13kgames] competition.  Js13kGames is an HTML5 game coding event that requires all entries to stay under a 13kb filesize limit.  The theme for 2013 was "bad luck".

Lucky Streak took 17th place overall, and 5th place in the mobile category.

### Play It ###

> You're a block. You're naked (don't worry, it's censored). You're out for a jog. Run and jump as far as you can. Avoid stepping on cracks in the sidewalk or your luck may run out as the earth opens up to swallow you whole. Good luck!

You can [play the game here][lucky-streak-fullscreen]. If you want to try it on mobile you should [play it on js13kgames.com][mobile-full] for now.

I tested the game on the following browsers/systems.  I'd expect it to work on any versions higher as well.

- Chrome 29
- Firefox 22
- IE 10
- Safari 8
- Mobile Safari on iPhone 4S and iPad 2
- Android 4.1.2
- Windows Phone 8

I recommend Chrome on desktop and iOS Safari on mobile.
